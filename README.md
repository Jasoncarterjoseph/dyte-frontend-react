# Online Code Editor Using React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

**Code Editor** is an online community for testing and showcasing user-created HTML, CSS and JavaScript code snippets. It functions as an online code editor and open-source learning environment, where developers can create code snippets, called "pens," and test them.

   git clone https://github.com/Jasoncarterjoseph/dyte-frontend-react.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   or 
   
     ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
3. Run the app

### `npm start or yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Features

1.	There are 3 sections, namely:
  a.	A “file explorer” pane that contains 3 files: index.html, index.css, index.js.
  b.	A “code editor” that supports syntax highlighting for HTML, CSS, and JS.
  c.	A “live view” section to show the rendered HTML website.
  
2.	Clicking on a file from the “file explorer” should display the corresponding content on the code editor for editing

3.	The “live view” section must display the rendered website that was created by the user. When a change is made to any of the index.html, index.css, or index.js files, the “live view” section should hot-reload, and display the new output.

4. Implemented PASTEBIN API. Created a feature to save your code, and generate a shareable link (such as https://editor.io/edit/<unique-id>) that should show the saved code when the link is visited. Use the Pastebin Developer API to save your code, generate a unique link, and then load it back at a later stage.
  (Network Error)
 
5. Deploy the website on Github pages.
