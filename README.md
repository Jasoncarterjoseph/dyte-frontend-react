# Online Code Editor Using React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

**Code Editor** is an online community for testing and showcasing user-created HTML, CSS and JavaScript code snippets. It functions as an online code editor and open-source learning environment, where developers can create code snippets, called "pens," and test them.

### Features

1.	There are 3 sections, namely:
  a.	A “file explorer” pane that contains 3 files: index.html, index.css, index.js.
  b.	A “code editor” that supports syntax highlighting for HTML, CSS, and JS.
  c.	A “live view” section to show the rendered HTML website.
  
2.	Clicking on a file from the “file explorer” should display the corresponding content on the code editor for editing

3.	The “live view” section must display the rendered website that was created by the user. When a change is made to any of the index.html, index.css, or index.js files, the “live view” section should hot-reload, and display the new output.
